# Cursor Rules for Delirium Paste

## Change Documentation Organization

- **Change documentation** (fix summaries, migration notes, analysis documents, regression reports, etc.) must be placed in the `docs/` directory, organized by PR-named folders.
- Create a folder structure like `docs/prs/PR-XXX-<description>/` for each PR's change documentation.
- Examples of change documentation that should follow this structure:
  - Fix summaries (e.g., `CI_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md`)
  - Migration notes and status documents
  - Regression analysis reports
  - Optimization analysis documents
  - Validation summaries
  - Any temporary or PR-specific documentation

- **Do not** place change documentation files in the repository root. Keep the root clean and organized.
- For PRs that don't have a specific number yet, use descriptive folder names like `docs/prs/fix-ci-checks/` or `docs/prs/optimization-analysis/`.

## Examples

Instead of:
- `CI_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` (root)
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` (root)

Use:
- `docs/prs/PR-XXX-fix-ci-checks/CI_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/prs/PR-XXX-deployment-fixes/DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md`
