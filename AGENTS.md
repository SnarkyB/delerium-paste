# Repository Guidelines for AI Agents

See **CLAUDE.md** for comprehensive project guidance, security protocol, testing requirements, and development commands.

## Quick Reference

- **Deploy:** `./deploy.sh local` | `./deploy.sh vps-setup domain email` | `./deploy.sh production`
- **Test:** `make ci-check` (run before every PR)
- **Change docs:** Place in `docs/prs/PR-XXX-<description>/`, never in repo root
