# 🚀 Deployment Automation and Security Enhancements

## Overview

This PR transforms Delirium from a basic development setup into a **production-ready, security-hardened, headless-friendly** zero-knowledge paste system. It adds comprehensive deployment automation, security enhancements, and operational tools while maintaining the existing zero-knowledge architecture.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Delirium required multiple manual steps to deploy, had no security hardening for production environments, and lacked operational monitoring tools.

**After:** One-command deployment with comprehensive security, monitoring, and operational tools suitable for production headless environments.

## ✨ Key Features Added

### 🛠️ **Deployment Automation**
- **One-command setup**: `make quick-start` for first-time users
- **Headless support**: `make quick-start-headless` for servers/CI
- **Development mode**: `make dev` with hot-reload capabilities
- **Comprehensive Makefile**: 15+ commands for all common tasks

### 🔒 **Security Enhancements**
- **Security hardening**: Container isolation, read-only filesystems, capability dropping
- **Enhanced nginx**: Security headers, rate limiting, request filtering
- **Environment security**: Secure token generation, file permissions
- **Security verification**: Automated security checks and monitoring

### 📊 **Operational Tools**
- **Health monitoring**: Continuous service health checks
- **Resource monitoring**: Memory, disk, and CPU monitoring
- **Auto-recovery**: Automatic service restart on failure
- **Backup system**: Automated backups with retention policies
- **Log management**: Structured logging with rotation

### 🌐 **Headless Environment Support**
- **No browser dependencies**: Fully headless operation
- **Remote monitoring**: Log-based monitoring and alerting
- **Security verification**: Comprehensive security checks
- **Production-ready**: Suitable for unknown security environments
