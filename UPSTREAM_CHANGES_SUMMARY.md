## New Feature Branch Discovered

### Branch: `feature/pr-serial-quality-gates`
A new branch has been pushed to the remote that adds comprehensive CI/CD quality gates.

**Branch Status**: 4 commits ahead of `main`

#### Changes Include:

##### 1. **New GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`)
A comprehensive PR checks workflow that runs serial quality gates:

**Frontend Checks:**
- ✅ ESLint linting
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Unit tests
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ E2E tests (Playwright)
- ✅ Coverage report generation
- ✅ Coverage threshold enforcement (85% minimum)
- ✅ Security audit (`npm audit`)

**Backend Checks:**
- ✅ Gradle build
- ✅ Kotlin/Ktor tests
- ✅ Dependency security check (OWASP)

**Infrastructure Checks:**
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration validation
- 🔧 Optional: Docker Compose build
- 🔧 Optional: Artifact uploads
- 🔧 Optional: Staging deployment

**Trigger**: Runs on all pull requests to any branch

##### 2. **Package.json Updates**
The workflow expects certain npm scripts that may need to be added:
- `npm run eslint` - Linting (not currently in package.json)
- `npm run typecheck` - Type checking (not currently in package.json)

**Current package.json scripts:**
```json
{
  "build": "tsc",
  "watch": "tsc --watch",
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  "test:unit": "jest --testPathIgnorePatterns=/integration/ --testPathIgnorePatterns=/e2e/",
  "test:integration": "jest --config jest.integration.config.js",
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:all": "npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration && npm run test:e2e"
}
```

## Recommendations

### For `first-run` Branch:
1. **Option A**: Close this PR without merging (it was exploratory)
2. **Option B**: Merge as-is (no harm since net changes are zero)
3. **Option C**: Rebase to remove the commit/revert pair for cleaner history

### For `feature/pr-serial-quality-gates` Branch:
1. **Review the workflow** - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline ready to use
2. **Add missing npm scripts** to `client/package.json`:
   - `"eslint": "eslint src/**/*.ts"`
   - `"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"`
3. **Consider merging** this branch to enable automated quality gates
4. **Add ESLint** as a dependency if not already present
5. **Configure OWASP dependency-check** plugin in `build.gradle.kts` for backend security scanning

### Documentation Updates Needed:
If the `feature/pr-serial-quality-gates` branch is merged, update README.md to document:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline section** - Add details about the automated checks
2. **Quality Gates section** - Document the 85% coverage requirement
3. **Contributing section** - Update to mention PR checks that will run
4. **Development Setup** - Add ESLint and type checking commands
