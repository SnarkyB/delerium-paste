### Log4j Analysis
- **Current Version:** 2.24.0 (released December 2024)
- **Latest Version:** 2.25.2 (released September 2025)
- **Status:** Update available but not critical
- **Recommendation:** Consider updating to 2.25.2 for latest security patches and bug fixes

**Note:** Log4j 2.24.0 is a relatively recent version released after the major Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability. The version in use is from the 2.24.x series which includes security fixes.

## Security Configuration Check

### ✅ Passed Checks
- Security headers configured (X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- Running as non-root user
- Containers properly configured
- Health endpoint accessible
- Disk usage within acceptable limits

### ⚠️ Recommendations
1. **Log4j Update:** Update to 2.25.2 for latest security patches
2. **File Permissions:** Consider tightening .env file permissions to 600
3. **Content Security Policy:** CSP header is missing (may be intentional for development)
4. **Dependency Monitoring:** Set up automated dependency vulnerability scanning

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Level: **LOW** ✅

- No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities found
- Frontend dependencies are secure
- Backend dependencies are generally current
- One non-critical update available (Log4j)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **No critical actions required** - Release is safe to deploy

### Short-term Actions (Next Release)
1. Update Log4j to 2.25.2 for latest security patches
2. Configure automated dependency vulnerability scanning
3. Add Content Security Policy headers for production

### Long-term Actions
1. Set up automated dependency update checks
2. Implement OWASP Dependency Check plugin for Gradle
3. Regular security audits (quarterly recommended)
4. Monitor security advisories for all dependencies

## Tools Used

- **npm audit** - Frontend dependency scanning
- **Security Check Script** - Configuration and runtime security
- **Manual Review** - Dependency version analysis

## Notes

- Log4j 2.24.0 is post-Log4Shell and includes security fixes
- All frontend dependencies are actively maintained
- Backend dependencies are from reputable sources (Apache, JetBrains, etc.)
- No known CVEs affecting the current dependency versions
